# UK Race Alarm 👋

This is an Expo project that provides alarms for UK & Irish horse races. Set alarms for all races or toggle them individually to receive a two-minute warning before the race is off.

## Features

- **Daily Race List**: View all of today's UK & Irish horse races in a clean, easy-to-read list.
- **Bulk Alarm Control**: Start or stop alarms for all upcoming races with a single large, accessible button.
- **Individual Alarms**: Tap the status indicator on any race to toggle its alarm on or off, giving you granular control.
- **Two-Minute Warnings**: Receive a push notification two minutes before each selected race is due to start.
- **Live Countdown**: See a real-time countdown timer for each race that has an active alarm.
- **Auto-Updating List**: Finished races are automatically removed from the list to keep the view focused on what's next.
